# Simple Population Simulator

This project simulates births and deaths around the world using React.js. It visualizes population changes over time, making use of D3.js for geographical mapping and dynamic data display. The simulation generates countries based on population and birth rates and shows real-time population trends.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of population changes
- Dynamic map with visualized birth and death rates
- Country selection based on probability
- Flags displayed for each country
- Animated sorting of countries based on population data
